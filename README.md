# discourse-status

A little bit of JavaScript I wrote to make the _logged in_ status of [Nomad Gate community](https://community.nomadgate.com) users in the associated Jekyll based blog.

You can see how it works on [Nomad Gate](https://nomadgate.com).

It will get:

- The logged-in status
- The full name and first name of current user
- The username of current user
- The user ID of current user
- The number of unread notifications for current user
- The number of unread messages for current user
- The email address of current user

Hope you'll find it useful!

PS! Make sure to allow CORS requests from wherever you're trying to run the script!
